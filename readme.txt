== Description ==

WordPress plugin to turn standard WordPress feeds into iTunes, Google and Spotify compatible podcasts

The plugin changes the standard RSS2 feed so that the link each feed points back to the human readable page of the same content.  It also adds the minimally required iTunes tags with options to set the iTunes category, logo and also a copyright statement or link.

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin `WPFeedsToPodcasts` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin using the 'Plugins' menu in your WordPress admin panel.
3. You can adjust the necessary settings using your WordPress admin panel in "Feeds To Podcasts".
4. Set the category, explicit status, logo and copyright statement.
5. Enjoy.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't it do...? =
The plugin is deliberately designed to provide a minimalistic way of supporting iTunes, Google and Spotify requirements from standard WP feeds.  It deliberately does nothing more.  There are many very good full-featured podcast plugins with which this is not designed to compete.

== Changelog ==

= 0.0.1 - 26th August 2020 =
